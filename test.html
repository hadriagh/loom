<p><strong>Austin, Texas, Nov. 11, 2010 -</strong> The results of a nationwide phone survey conducted by Ipsos Public Affairs and commissioned by <a href="http://www.offers.com/">Offers.com</a> shows that while 63 percent of online shoppers search for online coupons or deals at least some of the time before making an online purchase, only 21 percent report doing so most or all of the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to see 63 percent of online shoppers look for coupons or deals when they shop online. But while these results are promising, only 21 percent of consumers regularly do so,&#8221; said Steve Schaffer, founder and <span class="caps">CEO</span> of Offers.com. &#8220;Our goal with Offers.com is to help the 79 percent of online shoppers that don&#8217;t regularly look for a coupon or deals site before they purchase something online. We help consumers find the right offer for their needs by making sure all the offers on our site are categorized, valid, and reliable.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="/press/fall-study-2010/">nationwide phone survey</a> conducted by Ipsos Public Affairs in October 2010 polled consumers who shop online at least a few times a year. Among the findings:</p>
<ul>
	<li>63 percent of consumers look for online coupons or deals when making an online purchase (nine percent report &#8220;always,&#8221; 12 percent report &#8220;most of the time,&#8221; and 42 percent occasionally.&quot;)</li>
	<li>In contrast, 37 percent &#8220;never&#8221; search for online coupons or deals when shopping online.</li>
	<li>Frequent online shoppers (those who make online purchases at least weekly) are more likely than those who make online purchases less frequently to search for online coupons and deals regularly (30 percent vs. 19 percent).</li>
	<li>Shoppers from higher income households (over $75,000 income) are slightly more likely to regularly search for coupons or deals (23 percent vs. 21percent).</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;While some research about online coupon use has been released, this survey takes a deeper look at how many consumers are taking advantage of savings opportunities when shopping online,&#8221; said Julio Franco, senior research manager for Ipsos Public Affairs. &#8220;The results show that many consumers are looking for coupons or deals at least some of the time, and those who make online purchases more frequently, and are arguably more experienced online shoppers are looking for deals and coupons more often than the rest.&#8221;</p>
<h4>Holiday Shopping</h4>
<p>The phone survey also asked consumers about plans to shop for the holiday season this year:</p>
<ul>
	<li>While the majority of consumers (58 percent) report planning to spend about the same as last year, 10 percent report planning to spend more (eight percent &#8220;somewhat more&#8221; and two percent &#8220;significantly more.&#8221;)</li>
	<li>Online shoppers who do search for online coupons and deals regularly are more likely to say they plan to spend more this holiday season than those who search for coupons or deals only sporadically.</li>
	<li>37 percent of respondents are planning to shop on Black Friday this year and 18 percent are planning to shop on Cyber Monday.</li>
	<li>Of those who are planning to shop on Black Friday, half of them (49 percent) plan to do at least part of their shopping online.</li>
	<li>Of those planning to shop on Cyber Monday, more than half (57 percent) are planning to visit a coupon or deal Web site.</li>
</ul>
